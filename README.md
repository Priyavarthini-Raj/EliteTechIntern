# EliteTechIntern
 
EliteTechIntern is a repository dedicated to projects, assignments, and resources from my internship at EliteTech Intern in the field of Cybersecurity. This repository serves as a structured collection of hands-on tasks, research materials, and technical documentation that I have worked on during my virtual internship, contributing to my professional development and industry expertise.


**TOOL 1 : FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER**

File Integrity Checker designed to monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing hash values. It helps detect unauthorized modifications, additions, or deletions of files in a specified directory, making it useful for security monitoring and forensic analysis.

📌 **How It Works**

1️⃣**Calculates File Hashes**

Uses SHA-256 hashing via the hashlib library.
Reads the file in chunks and generates a unique hash.

2️⃣ **Loads Previously Stored Hashes**

Checks for a JSON file (file_hashes.json) that stores hashes from previous runs.
If the file exists, it loads the stored hash values.

3️⃣ **Compares Current vs. Stored Hashes**

If a file’s hash value has changed, it flags it as modified.
If a new file appears, it identifies it as new.
If a file is missing, it reports it as deleted.

4️⃣ **Updates the Hash Database**

After checking, the script updates the file_hashes.json file with the latest hash values for future monitoring.

📌 **How to Use**

**🚀 Running the Script**

1. Save the script as file_integrity_checker.py.
2. Run the script 
3. Enter the directory to monitor when prompted.
4. Check for warnings about modified, new, or deleted files.

🛠 **Example Usage**

**Enter the directory to monitor:** /home/user/documents

**[NEW]** New file detected: /home/user/documents/report.pdf

**[WARNING]** File changed: /home/user/documents/config.txt

**[DELETED]** File missing: /home/user/documents/logs.log

**[INFO]** Integrity check completed.



**TOOL 2 : WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITY SCANNER**

This Python-based Web Application Vulnerability Scanner is designed to identify common security weaknesses in web applications, such as SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The tool automates scanning by analyzing web forms and injecting test payloads to detect vulnerabilities.

**📌 How It Works**

1️⃣ **Extracts Forms from Web Pages**

Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract <form> elements.
Identifies input fields where vulnerabilities may exist.

2️⃣ **Tests for SQL Injection (SQLi)**

Injects common SQL payloads like:

       ' OR '1'='1
       '; DROP TABLE users; --
       
If the response suggests database errors or authentication bypass, the form is flagged as vulnerable.

**3️⃣ Tests for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

Injects malicious JavaScript payloads, such as:

             <script>alert('XSS')</script>
             
If the script executes in the browser, it indicates an XSS vulnerability.

**4️⃣ Analyzes Responses**

Compares responses before and after payload injection.
If the payload is reflected in the response without proper sanitization, the tool reports the vulnerability.

**📌 How to Use**

**🔧 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries:

        pip install requests beautifulsoup4
        
**🚀 Running the Script**

1. Save the script as web_vuln_scanner.py.
2. Run the script 
3. Enter the target URL when prompted.
4. Review the output for any detected vulnerabilities.

**🛠 Example Usage**

**Enter the target URL:** http://example.com

[+] Testing 2 forms on http://example.com for SQL Injection...
[!] SQL Injection detected on http://example.com/login using payload: ' OR '1'='1

[+] Testing 2 forms on http://example.com for XSS...
[!] XSS detected on http://example.com/search using payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

[INFO] Scanning completed.

**TOOL 3 : PENETRATION TESTING TOOLKIT**

The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a Python-based 🐍 modular toolkit designed for ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals. It includes multiple modules to assist in penetration testing:

🔍 Port Scanner – Scans for open ports on a target machine.

🔑 SSH Brute Forcer – Attempts to crack SSH credentials using a password list.

🌐 HTTP Status Checker – Checks if a website is online or offline.

**📌How It Works**

**1️⃣ Port Scanner 🔍**

✅ Takes a target IP and a list of ports.

✅ Uses Python’s socket module to detect open ports.

✅ Prints results for open ports.

**2️⃣ SSH Brute Forcer 🔑**

✅ Takes a target IP, SSH username, and password list.

✅ Tries different passwords from the list.

✅ If successful, it prints credentials.

**3️⃣ HTTP Status Checker 🌐**

✅ Takes a URL as input.

✅ Sends a request using requests and returns the status code.

✅ Checks if the website is online or offline.

**📌 How to Use**

**🔧 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries:

          pip install paramiko requests scapy

**2️⃣ Running the Toolkit 🎯**

Run the Python script:

python pen_test_toolkit.py

**You'll see a menu like this:**

Penetration Testing Toolkit  
1. Port Scanner  
2. SSH Brute Force  
3. HTTP Status Checker
    
**Choose an option:** 

**🔍 Option 1: Port Scanner**

**Usage:**
Enter the target IP
Enter the ports to scan (comma-separated)
**Example:**
Enter target IP: 192.168.1.1  
Enter ports to scan (comma-separated): 22,80,443 

✅ The tool scans and displays open ports.

**🔑 Option 2: SSH Brute Force**

**Usage:**
Enter the target IP
Enter the SSH username
Provide a password list file
**Example:**
Enter target IP: 192.168.1.10  
Enter SSH username: admin  
Enter password list file path: passwords.txt  

✅ The tool tries logging in with different passwords and shows successful credentials.

**🌐 Option 3: HTTP Status Checker**

**Usage:**
Enter the website URL
**Example:**
Enter the website URL: https://example.com  

✅ The tool checks if the website is online or offline and shows the HTTP status code.

**TOOL 4 : ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL (AES-256)**

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. It ensures strong security for sensitive files while providing a simple GUI interface for ease of use.

**📌 How It Works**

1️⃣ The script generates a random AES-256 key and saves it in a file (aes_key.key).

2️⃣ **Encrypting:**

Reads the file and generates a random IV (16 bytes)
Uses AES-CBC mode for encryption
Applies PKCS7 padding to make the data a multiple of 16 bytes
Saves the encrypted file with the IV included

**3️⃣ Decrypting:**

Reads the IV from the encrypted file
Uses the same AES-256 key to decrypt the file
Removes padding and restores the original file

**📌 How to Use**

**1. Run the Application**

**2. Execute the script:**

            python encryption_tool.py

**Encrypt a File**

1️⃣ Click "Encrypt File"

2️⃣ Select a file from your system

3️⃣ The tool will encrypt it and save it as <filename>.enc

**Decrypt a File**

1️⃣ Click "Decrypt File"

2️⃣ Select an encrypted .enc file

3️⃣ The tool will decrypt and restore the original file
